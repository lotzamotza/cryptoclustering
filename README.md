# cryptoclustering
Python and unsupervised learning algorithms are used to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.
K-means is used to group similar data points into clusters, and the elbow method helps determine the optimal number of clusters by evaluating a range of the possible values.
Dimensionality reduction was performed with Principle Component Analysis to simplify the large datasets.
